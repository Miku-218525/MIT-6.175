Write your answers to these questions in the text file discussion.txt provided with the initial lab code.

1.How many gates does your one-bit multiplexer use? The 5-bit multiplexer? Write down a formula for the number of gates in an N-bit multiplexer. (2 Points)
  1比特多路复用器使用了4个门（2个与门，1个或门，1个非门）；
  5比特多路复用器使用了20个门；
  N比特多路复用器使用了4*N个门。
2.Assume a single full adder requires 5 gates. How many gates does the 8-bit ripple-carry adder require? How many gates does the 8-bit carry-select adder require? (2 Points)
  8-bit ripple-carry adder需要40个门（相当于8个1比特全加器级联，5*8）；
  8-bit carry-select adder需要84个门（3个4比特全加器有3*4*5=60个门，1个1比特多路复用器有4个门，1个5比特多路复用器有4*5=20个门）。
3.Assume a single full adder requires A time unit to compute its outputs once all its inputs are valid and a mux requires M time unit to compute its output. In terms of A and M, how long does the 8-bit ripple-carry adder take? How long does the 8-bit carry-select adder take? (2 Points)
  8-bit ripple-carry adder需要时间：8*A
  8-bit carry-select adder需要时间：4*A+M
4.Optional: How long did you take to work on this lab?
